# DMProject

This project was created as an exercise for the course "Data Mining and Learning Algorithms."

To run it you need to add the projects datasets in a new directory called "datasets". For the first exercise add another directory called "1" and for the second one, a directory called "2".
So the files shoudl be in the directories "datasets/1" and "datasets/2".
